Summary of LabelStream Classes:

DATATYPES:

DataType is the abstract class which call datatypes inherit. At the moment, the only
mandatory function is a distance function for the clusters. 

Subtypes:

IntegerType: Captures integral data. This has min and maxes for normalising data. 
DoubleType: Has identical data.
CategoricalType: For string data. Has no min or max because its non sensical. 

PROGRAMME FLOW:

Firstly, DATAPROCESSOR class read in data from a file, and creates a DATAPOINT, a single tuple
in an input stream, which contains vital information on whether it is labelled and so forth. 
DATA CHUNK calls DATAPROCESSOR to make a frame of data. This data 
chunk is what we use to perform the clustering operations on. 

MODELS:

A model contains much of the vital processing on a data chunk. It will take the data, 
cluster into macroclusters using expectation minimisation, then each cluster will be 
subdivided into microclusters. There are 3 clustering classes to facilitate this. 

Then, those microclusters will be summarised into Pseudopoints. Then we can perform 
label propagation on those pseudopoints.

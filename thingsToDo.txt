Problems with the LabelStream algorithm:

1) The integerData type and Double Data types share min and max values amongst the types:
- there should be a way to have min and max for each attribute.

2) When recalculating the centroid, determining which string value should be the average
for those points is probably broken. 

3) Need to ensure the expectation maximisation being currently used is correct and 
does indeed converge. 

4) Is the method for expectation maximisation with the checking and swapping of labelled 
points too slow?

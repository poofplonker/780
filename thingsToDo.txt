Problems with the LabelStream algorithm:

1) Need to fix problem where there are duplicate points in the datachunk and there are duplicate centroids leading
to empty centroids
2) Implement pseudopoint deletion for inaccurate pseudopoints. 

Late August:

- Change the model evaluation to be the real test data, not the data that the original model was trained on. 

Corrections that made things worse:

- Changing the gaussian distances from xi-xj to ||xi-xj||
- Changing the centroid cluster recalculation to normalised values
- Fixing the DC for unlabelled points (greatly improved convergence)
